# basic usage

using the dell XPS laptop (only machine set up for the job)

1. run generate docs script to generate intermediate markdown reports
1. ensure all photos where pulled from google drive - if not repeat previous step
1. run the shrink-photos script to downsample images and reduce report size
1. run the F1 Markdown all in one - print all documents to pdf to generate intermediate html (be aware of PITFALL mentioned below)
1. open each html report individualy and print to save out as .pdf for sending forward

> PITFALL: this operation lauches a popup window hidden behind the in-focus vs codium application. this single operation targets the whole generated-docs folder to produce an equivalent html folder. FIRST select the _**SOURCE FOLDER**_ from the file browser then SECOND specify the _**DESTINATION FOLDER**_ using the text box
