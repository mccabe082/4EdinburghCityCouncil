It is worth starting this section by contrasting Mr Donald’s Inspection report of 3<sup>rd</sup> June 2021 with Mr Armour’s account which took place later that same year.  Mr Donald’s Report states:-

>*“In the front facing master bedroom suite <ins>the movement has been of sufficient magnitude as to disturb the adjustment of the doors to both the room and its en suite</ins> with the result that they do not satisfactorily close.*<br/><br/>
*<ins>Similarly windows require adjustment to freely function</ins> where previously (that is before the extensive vibration disturbance) that was not reported to be a problem.”*

Mr Armour’s Inspection report states:-

>*“The window opens out to the front of the building and is said to be difficult to open, allegation is that this has occurred due to movement of the building.  We tested the window and did find it to be stiff although there was evidence of debris within the internal frame, that could be the actual cause.*<br/>*<ins>An inspection of the window return, corresponding external blockwork and internal plasterboard identified no cracks or movement in the building.</ins>”*

- Although internal cracking under the window ledge was pointed out to Mr Armour on his visit it was not included in his Inspection Report.
- Since his visit, cracking has appeared on the outside of the building
- Mr Armour’s report omits two cracks in the bottom corner of the wall which has the water stain.  Although he indicates that the moisture did not register dampness, water staining is clearly visible in the photograph provided.  In addition the Factor has written to all tenants regarding a possible movement of the roof which has already led to repairs and the Factor is currently:-
  >*“In the process of obtaining estimates in relation to a survey of the building fabric, following concerns raised by owners regarding structural integrity.  These concerns relate to heavy duty Tram works over several years and I understand owners have contacted Edinburgh Council directly.*<br/>- Letter dated 31st January 2022 (Appendix????) -->
