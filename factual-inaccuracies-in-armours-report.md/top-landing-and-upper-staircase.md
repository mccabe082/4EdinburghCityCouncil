## Top Landing: Stairs

**Although the Report identifies zig zag cracks as being present and shows a photograph which was thought to be the stairs, it is actually bedroom 1**

- The vertical hairline cracks which are described as not extending to ceiling or the floor actually do **(insert photograph)**
- Mr Armour’s assertion the cracks which follow the wall stringer on the stairs were actually paint lines rather than cracks were dismissed as spurious by our surveyor on his 2nd visit.  He also dismissed Mr Armour’s explanation that:- <br/><br/>*“over time, the weight of persons will allow the timber to flex and open up the paint lines. In our opinion this damage is due to normal usage “*

We were shown a number of cracks on the stairwell; vertical hairline cracks on the main wall at the midpoint which did not extend to the ceiling or floor. The joint which follows the stair stringer had also opened up.

Upon examination there a clear movement of the plasterboard at the internal side of the staircase which was due to a lack of fixings directly behind. Over time, the weight of persons walking up and down the stairs will allow the timber to flex and open up the paint lines. In our opinion this ‘damage’ is due to normal usage.
