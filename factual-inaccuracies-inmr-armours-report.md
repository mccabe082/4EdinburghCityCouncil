## Stairs
**Although the Report identifies zig zag cracks as being present and shows a photograph which was thought to be the stairs, it is actually bedroom 1**

- The vertical hairline cracks which are described as not extending to ceiling or the floor actually do **(insert photograph)**
- Mr Armour’s assertion the cracks which follow the wall stringer on the stairs were actually paint lines rather than cracks were dismissed as spurious by our surveyor on his 2nd visit.  He also dismissed Mr Armour’s explanation that:- <br/><br/>*“over time, the weight of persons will allow the timber to flex and open up the paint lines. In our opinion this damage is due to normal usage “*


## Kitchen/ Lounge
- What the Inspection Report describes as paint lines are quite clearly cracks
- We accept that the issue at the corner wall junction is a blown edged tape.
- Mr Armour was informed that the damage to the lounge window was recorded in the sellers’ Home Report at the time of purchase.  It had been reported to Trams to Newhaven by the previous owner who was advised that any repairs would be undertaken when the Tram project had been completed.  The damage to the lounge window and the damage to the window above the shop door at No16 both occurred in the early stages of the excavations.<br/><br/>Because of the inadequacies of the Council’s pre-construction survey, [ none of the  photographs taken actually show our 3rd and 4th floor flat] we cannot prove the damage occurred during the early excavation of our street. However, one of the photographs taken of the shop door at number 16 which is immediately below us shows that the window which is above the door shows no damage at the time of the photograph, but has suffered damage during the time of the tram works.<br/><br/>We resent the inuendo in Mr Armour’s account of our discussion on the damage to the lounge window.  He states;-<br/><br/>*“Mr McCabe rejoined the inspection whilst we were in this room. We identified a crack to the front facing lounge window to which he was unable to confirm when it occurred but that it was due to vibrations.  Interestingly we drew Mrs McCabe’s attention to the same crack a short time later, her response was that it had always been there”*<br/>The explanation for what Mr Armour obviously took as suspicious, conflicting accounts is straightforward:-
- Mr McCabe felt unable to confirm when the damage occurred because it pre-dated our purchase of the property, but he did not know the precise date;
- Mrs McCabe’s statement that the crack has always been there is also accurate in that, because it pre-dated entry to the property it has always been there since we purchased the property.<br/><br/>Rather than highlighting evidence of deception, this short exchange demonstrates that Mr Armour’s energy and effort is directed towards questioning the legitimacy of our claim, rather than recording the extent of the damage.<br/><br/>What is significant is that the crack has expanded considerably over the period of the Tram works, as has the crack in the window above the shop door which is almost directly below it;<br/>
**(Insert 2 photos)**
- Evidence of vibrational damage to this window was also evident in relation to the window sill which had come lose and the architrave which had come apart from the sill.  When Mr Armour inspected our property, he was shown the architrave which helped fix the window sill to the wall.   The glue on the wall shown in the first photograph and the architrave’s metal studs shown in the second photograph show how it was held together for the 16 years prior to the Tram works commencing.  Helpfully a photograph of the architrave in situ is shown in two of the photographs contained in the Seller’s Schedule.
- Mr Armour’s suggestion that the eight metal screws found on top of the concrete block below the windowsill were intended to screw it down is something of a leap, a second attempt at playing detective, and a second demonstration of partiality. None of the other wooden windowsills in the flat are screwed down and it seems unlikely that the tradesmen would have suddenly decided to adopt a different method for securing this one.<br/>**Insert  3 PHOTOS**<br/>**(Insert photos  1st showing the grips 2nd showing the glue on the wall and 3rd Home report)**
- Although Mr Armour was shown an external crack running down the blockwork on the LHS of the right lounge window, his Inspection Report fails to mention it <br/><br/>**INSERT PHOTOGRAPH**
- The Report also omitted both the internal and external crack on the LHS of the kitchen window
- The groove in the lounge floor which is clearly caused by the door scraping on the laminate is not evident in the photograph contained in the Sellers Schedule<br/>produced by Cameron Stephen at the time of the sale.  It certainly should have been, if Mr Armours explanation of the cause was valid.<br/><br/>Mrs McCabe also drew Mr Armour’s attention to the fact that the door required to be closed with substantial force before it would stay shut.  We took that as additional evidence of distortion in the door frame.  In his report, Mr Armour correctly stated that there was no evidence of open joints to the frame.  That is no longer the case as is demonstrated in the photograph.<br/><br/>**INSERT PHOTO**
- At the time of the inspection Mr Armour was shown cracks above and between both lounge windows.  They were omitted from his Inspection Report.<br/><br/>**Insert photo of cracks.**<br/><br/>These cracks are not evident in any of the three photographs shown in the Sellers Schedule produced by Cameron Stephen in preparation for the sale of the property in April 2020.  **INSERT 3 Photographs**
- Since Mr Armour’s inspection vertical cracks have appeared in the plasterboard partition between the lounge and the kitchen<br/><br/>**INSERT PHOTOGRAPH**

## Main Stairwell
This section of the Inspection Report begins by suggesting the movement of the door is heavy.  Since the door is essentially a softwood timber frame with laminate covering we find this difficult to accept. That the cracking runs down both sides of the door further undermines the suggestion a heavy movement could account for cracking which runs up and along the ceiling and across the wall which links our flat to number 12 which also suffers from external cracking.

**INSERT PHOTOS**

In terms of the stairwell window, we noted that the Inspection Report only makes reference to the internal cracks above the window excluding the internal cracks below it. In addition, the Report does not cover the external crack to the bottom LHS of the stairwell window.  **INSERT PHOTO**

On the lower level of the stairs, there are 3 cracks of uneven size on the wall which is shared with number 16. These were omitted from the Inspection Report. **INSERT PHOTO**

Although the report records there are no external cracks on the front elevation, both the cracks which existed and those that have appeared since have been covered in the appropriate section of this report.

The final section of the Report records the crack below the window of bedroom 2, but fails to record the crack below the stairwell window which we already covered in the stairwell section.
Since the Inspection, we have identified two extensive cracks on the gable end of the building.  **INSERT PHOTO**

Beyond our own building, we are also aware of damage to:
1. the Grade A listed Sculpture on the building across the road;
2. No 12 which is clearly visible from several of our windows; and
3. The window above the door of Number 16 which is directly below us.
